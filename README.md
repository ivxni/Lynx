# Mistral OCR Conversion App: Context & Features

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a high-level overview of the **Mistral OCR Conversion App**. The aim of this app is to allow users to quickly convert images of documents into fully searchable PDF documents using the **Mistral OCR** service. The frontend is built with **Lynx**, the backend uses **Node.js (Express)**, and **MongoDB** is used as the database.

## 2. Core Objectives
1. **Simple and Modern UI**: A minimalistic 2025 design approach, focusing on user-friendliness.
2. **OCR Conversion**: Integrate Mistral OCR API to process image files and produce PDF outputs.
3. **Single Task Flow**: The user can convert one document at a time, ensuring clarity and avoiding confusion.
4. **History Tracking**: The user can review previously converted documents.
5. **File Management**: Users can save or share the converted PDFs.

## 3. App Flow Summary
Below is a simplified overview of the user journey:

1. **Welcome Screen**  
   - Clean, modern landing page.  
   - Offers a signup button or a prompt to log in if the user already has an account.

2. **Signup / Login**  
   - Allows the user to create a new account using their email address or log in with existing credentials.  
   - On success, the user is directed to the main dashboard.

3. **Main Dashboard**  
   - Displays an **Upload** button for starting a new conversion task.  
   - Shows a brief instruction on how to use the OCR service.  
   - Provides a menu or icon for navigation to different sections (e.g., History, Settings, Logout).

4. **File Upload & Conversion**  
   - After clicking the **Upload** button, the user selects an image file (document picture).  
   - The system sends the file to the backend.  
   - The backend then calls the **Mistral OCR API**.  
   - A progress bar is displayed to indicate the conversion status.

5. **PDF Generation**  
   - The OCR API responds with a converted document in PDF format.  
   - The system stores this PDF in MongoDB or on a dedicated file storage.  
   - The user is notified when the conversion is complete.

6. **Save or Share**  
   - The user can then choose to **save** the resulting PDF in their document library or directly **share** it.  
   - Sharing options can include email or other integrated platforms.

7. **Document History**  
   - A dedicated page lists all previously converted documents.  
   - Each history item displays:  
     - Document name  
     - Creation date  
     - Option to download or share

8. **Logout**  
   - The user can log out at any time to end the session.

## 4. Detailed Feature Breakdown

- **Purpose**: Provide a clean entry point for new and returning users.  
- **Features**:  
  - Large signup or login buttons.  
  - Branding elements (logo, app name).  
  - Possibly a short tagline, e.g., *“Transform images to PDFs in just one click.”*

### 4.2 Signup & Login
- **Purpose**: Securely authenticate users.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - **Signup**: Collect email, password, and any basic user information.  
  - **Login**: Validate credentials against the database.  
  - **Password Handling**: Passwords should be hashed and never stored in plain text.  
  - **Session Management**: Use JWT or sessions to maintain authentication status.

### 4.3 Main Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Central hub for users after authentication.  
- **Key Elements**:  
  - **Upload Button**: Triggers the file selection and conversion process.  
  - **Menu**: Navigation to other sections (History, Settings, etc.).  
  - **Quick Stats** (optional): Show total documents converted or any personalized data.

### 4.4 File Upload & Mistral OCR Integration
- **Purpose**: Let the user attach an image file and convert it to a PDF using Mistral OCR.  
- **Workflow**:  
  1. **User selects file** in the app.  
  2. **Frontend** sends file data (or a reference) to the **Node.js (Express) backend**.  
  3. **Backend** calls **Mistral OCR API** with the uploaded file.  
  4. **OCR** returns the recognized text and a generated PDF.  
  5. **Backend** either temporarily stores the file or streams it directly to the database/storage.  
  6. A **progress bar** on the frontend updates the user about the status (uploading, processing, completed).

### 4.5 PDF Generation
- **Purpose**: Provide the final converted document to the user.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Store PDFs in **MongoDB** (GridFS) or a file storage service, referencing them in the database.  
  - Return the PDF link or ID to the frontend once processing is complete.  

### 4.6 Save & Share
- **Purpose**: Allow quick actions once the PDF is ready.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - **Save**: Moves the document into the user’s “converted documents” collection or folder.  
  - **Share**: Provide a share link or direct integration (email, external app, etc.).  
  - **UI**: Buttons or icons for each action, placed near the PDF preview or download link.

### 4.7 Document History
- **Purpose**: Access previously converted documents.  
- **Features**:  
  - List all documents with names, thumbnails, or short descriptions.  
  - **On-click**: Download or share.  
  - Remove or archive documents if desired.

### 4.8 Logout
- **Purpose**: End user session and maintain security.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - **Client-side**: Clear tokens or session data.  
  - **Server-side**: Invalidate session tokens if using session-based authentication.

## 5. High-Level Technical Overview

### 5.1 Frontend (Lynx)
- **Framework**: Lynx (a minimal UI library).  
- **Structure**:  
  - **Pages**: `WelcomePage`, `SignupPage`, `LoginPage`, `DashboardPage`, `HistoryPage`  
  - **Components**: `UploadButton`, `DocumentPreview`, `ProgressBar`, `Menu`

  - etc.

### 5.2 Backend (Node.js & Express)
- **API**:  
  - **Auth Routes**: Handle signup & login  
  - **OCR Route**: Endpoint for image upload and calling Mistral OCR  
  - **History Route**: Retrieve user’s past conversions  
- **Middleware**:  
  - **Authentication** (JWT or session-based)  
  - **File Handling** (multer or similar for uploads)  
  - **Error Handling** (centralized error responses)

### 5.3 Mistral OCR Integration
- **API Call**:

  - Possible retry or error handling if Mistral service is unreachable.

### 5.4 Database (MongoDB)
- **Data Storage**:  
  - **Users Collection**: Basic user profile & authentication info.  
  - **Documents Collection**: Metadata about each converted document (filename, user reference, date).  
  - **File Storage**: PDF files can be stored via GridFS or a separate storage system.

## 6. Future Enhancements
- **Multiple File Conversion**: Allow users to upload multiple images and combine into a single PDF.  
- **Editing Tools**: Add the ability to reorder or remove pages before finalizing the PDF.  
- **Notifications**: Notify users via email when conversions are complete.  
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin roles, usage limits, or premium features.

## 7. Security Considerations
- **File Scanning**: Ensure uploaded files are scanned for viruses.  
- **Secure API Keys**: Keep Mistral OCR API keys in safe environment variables.  
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS for all requests to protect user data.  
- **Access Control**: Validate user ownership of documents before displaying or allowing downloads.

## 8. Conclusion
